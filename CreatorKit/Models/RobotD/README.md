# Info
This is [Radiant's](https://github.com/Radiantxero) rig; all credits to him for making the rig. I am including his rig here because I believe it is the most vanilla-feeling rig. It is also quite beginner-friendly.

# How To Install/Use
Simply download the ZIP by clicking the link below and install it in Blender 4.2+. Then, open the menu by pressing the 'N' key and click the "Drifter Customizer" tab.
